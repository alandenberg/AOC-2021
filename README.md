# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

The solutions in this repository are far away from optimal, which means they are neither particularly fast nor particularly short.
My goal with this project was to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and get used to the language's syntax and features.
